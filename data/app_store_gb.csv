Today I saw an “upcoming transactions” button in my account view that I’d not seen before, and when I pressed it, the app listed all the direct debits that were due to go out of my account in the next week - which, by sheer coincidence, is exactly what I’d opened the app to find out. The app has this “effortlessly helpful” quality that has inspired me to write a review; I can’t remember the last time needed to in log into the Online Banking web portal, because the Barclays app does everything. I genuinely think all banks should take notes on what the Barclays dev team have done here - the app doesn’t just make day to day banking easier, it is the only app I’ve ever used that has genuinely useful “money management” features (rather than gimmicks and charts that just look pretty). By contrast, I also have an account with HSBC, and their app has always been dreadful to use (even after the recent updates), so I really see the difference first hand.

I’m interested in taking out a credit card, so I’m merely shopping around and browsing through to see what rates are available, not inputting my details to check any success for an application or anything like that at all, and there’s a section on the Barclays app to Barclaycard to see what cards are available. 

Meanwhile I check my credit record on Equifax and saw a load of soft searches initiated by Barclaycard and Barclays Group, when I never checked any eligibility criteria for any credit cards whilst on the Barclaycard part of the Barclays app. It’s like the Barclaycard app records each time I merely open the section and lays it on the credit record. 

A load of soft searches on a credit record wrecks it because when you make an application to lenders and they see the load of soft searches, they think you’re desperate and refuse to accept any applications.

 First you arrange the cheque within the guidelines in the viewfinder. There's no shutter button, maybe it will take a photo while you're still lining it up or rotating your phone, maybe it'll make you just hold your phone there for a while until it thinks you are desperate enough. Nevertheless, it's not impossible to capture what *should* be a great image, it's just made unnecessarily hard. 

 Wait for the next step though. The app shows you what it has done to the image. You guessed right! It has applied a random skew distortion to your perfectly flat cheque, and then also cropped one edge of it off complete with text, even though it was placed on a simple, contrasting, background. It asks you if the image is complete and in focus, you say no, you repeat the process a few times. 

 Eventually you get past the trials of step two. You can submit your images. Now the bank's back-end tells you the image is not acceptable, and you go back to step one.

2) I opened a current account. 

3) My current account did not appear in my App. OK, I think, I’ll remove the app and reinstall. 

4) I re-installed the app and plugged in my new current account details … but now there is no sign of the mortgage account. There’s no option to link the current account and the mortgage account, off Ed at least there isn’t one I can see. 

5) FAQs don’t help, and there’s no obvious online support. 

I can’t be the only one with this problem, right guys?

We are aware of a similar issue has been raised before e.g. if you scroll from Debit > credit, the “freeze card” link shows for a small period on the credit cards hub. This is due to a lag but the freeze card feature in the app is not currently available for credit cards. \r\n\r\nWhen trapping from Credit to Debit Card there is a time lag for the ‘View PIN & card details’ to be displayed. The feedback for the issue will be passed on to our relevant teams with a view to improve this in the future. Hope this helps. AG\r\n', 'modified': '2022-03-03T13:34:29Z'}",,,en,gb
