Today I saw an “upcoming transactions” button in my account view that I’d not seen before, and when I pressed it, the app listed all the direct debits that were due to go out of my account in the next week - which, by sheer coincidence, is exactly what I’d opened the app to find out. The app has this “effortlessly helpful” quality that has inspired me to write a review; I can’t remember the last time needed to in log into the Online Banking web portal, because the Barclays app does everything. I genuinely think all banks should take notes on what the Barclays dev team have done here - the app doesn’t just make day to day banking easier, it is the only app I’ve ever used that has genuinely useful “money management” features (rather than gimmicks and charts that just look pretty). By contrast, I also have an account with HSBC, and their app has always been dreadful to use (even after the recent updates), so I really see the difference first hand.

For example, when I go to “Manage accounts” on the phone there is a section on “Statement and letter preferences”, but this is not there on the ipad app. Also, the chat function on ipad is very slow. I don’t know if this is caused by the app or if it is due to lack of availability of staff. However, I just spent 50 minutes on a chat that should have taken 5-10 minutes. The agent repeatedly left and joined the conversation and there were unbearably long gaps in between. This was all to solve the above problem of getting statements - an issue I should have been able to take care of myself. When I mentioned this to the agent they told me to update the app, but it was already up t date. Later, I realised that the ipad app does not have the features they were telling me to look at. Hence: the ipad app is not as good (a real shame as it is easier to view everything on it!) AND your agents are not well trained in the functionality of the apps.

Reply back:
Hi again. I think the app needs the update itself as my own iPhone  magnifying settings work automatically on everything, not on the chosen app. So ones I tried to reduce the size of letters so I can see Barclays display as previously, It also automatically scales down lettering on other apps too. So the best would be to leave the app as it was before so an elderly can fix it him/ herself the size of the letters from the phone setting as they preferable will want to magnify everything at ones on every app.
Or,maybe enable something like this within the app settings, not the phone - I don’t know if it’s possible.",5,Magnified screen,Agg 123,"{'id': 26368408, 'body': ""Hi Agg 123, thank you for your review.

And it is very helpful that the Smart Investor information is now available with additional functionality.

Currently, I have an increase in the value of the account since it started compared to book value of over £XXXX (which is accurate) but it displays the percentage change in brackets as -4%. This is odd. An increase cannot be a percentage decline. And the percentage change figures for the change of the whole portfolio on the day and the change over time of each individual asset are completely accurate.
 
I rang up the help line, and they saw there was a discrepancy, but thought it was because I had held the account for less than a year.

I’m interested in taking out a credit card, so I’m merely shopping around and browsing through to see what rates are available, not inputting my details to check any success for an application or anything like that at all, and there’s a section on the Barclays app to Barclaycard to see what cards are available. 

Meanwhile I check my credit record on Equifax and saw a load of soft searches initiated by Barclaycard and Barclays Group, when I never checked any eligibility criteria for any credit cards whilst on the Barclaycard part of the Barclays app. It’s like the Barclaycard app records each time I merely open the section and lays it on the credit record. 

A load of soft searches on a credit record wrecks it because when you make an application to lenders and they see the load of soft searches, they think you’re desperate and refuse to accept any applications. Of course I opened a dispute with Equifax and got most of them removed, but I’m writing this to warn people interested in taking out a credit card to watch out for this sort of behaviour within the Barclays app.",1,Browsing the Barclaycard section in this app initiates a credit check each time?,DarthHayder,,,,en,gb,

Other niggles include data entry. For example: If you want to transfer funds between accounts, you select the two accounts, and then the field for the amount. At this point the keypad pops up (on an iPhone), and obscures the amount you’re typing in unless you scroll the window above.

The Barclays photo facility takes photos when you don’t want it to and at weird angles even when the phone is level to the cheque. It needs perfect light too. Barclays should sort it out. If they were to see how the Lloyds one performs you’d hope they would sort their act out. 

On a plus side it is in all aspects a pleasure to use. I can give it only one star though because of the sheer frustration I feel when trying to use the cheque photo function. 

Contact Barclays? Forget it! Have you tried? A complete and utter waste of time that results in losing one’s will to live. Shameful customer service. You can’t even ring head office and get put through to someone in the tech. team. Even finding the phone number takes initiative. They just don’t want to know. Abysmal.

Firstly, the biggest flaw is that notifications are broken (other reviews in Dec 22 have said the same thing) - the “push notifications” toggle switch won’t stick in the “on” position (it reverts to “off” automatically, meaning no notifications are possible). This is a fault and needs rectifying. Secondly the app now freezes a LOT - this has never happened before, but now happens daily, on every single screen. I have an iPhone 13 on iOS 16.2 so there should be no lag, but I (and my partner) have this regularly.

Starting my business there was so many things I was worried about but this app soon put some of them to bed. Not having to pay for other software elsewhere or create an invoicing template, and having them all stored in one place was excellent. Being able to pay cheques in through the app rather than having to take time out of my working day to get to a branch makes things so much easier and efficient. The one off payment for the chip and pin machine so people have more options to pay is a great option that no other bank was offering when I was deciding who to go with.

 First you arrange the cheque within the guidelines in the viewfinder. There's no shutter button, maybe it will take a photo while you're still lining it up or rotating your phone, maybe it'll make you just hold your phone there for a while until it thinks you are desperate enough. Nevertheless, it's not impossible to capture what *should* be a great image, it's just made unnecessarily hard. 

 Wait for the next step though. The app shows you what it has done to the image. You guessed right! It has applied a random skew distortion to your perfectly flat cheque, and then also cropped one edge of it off complete with text, even though it was placed on a simple, contrasting, background. It asks you if the image is complete and in focus, you say no, you repeat the process a few times. 

 Eventually you get past the trials of step two. You can submit your images. Now the bank's back-end tells you the image is not acceptable, and you go back to step one.

I can check balances, pay people, move funds between accounts, link my Barclaycard and adjust regular payments, all in one place and with the greatest of ease.

However, there are two issues that I've come across, although they're relatively small and don't aggravate to the extent that it removes a star from my rating.

1) The new Siri functionality, while great in theory, does not work. I've tried several times to pay someone using their account number as well as their mobile number. I get through all the steps and authorise the payment, but it never goes through. Using the app itself is flawless though.

2) The Watch app is very temperamental. It has improved lately but it is still not entirely reliable. It used to not work at all, but now it usually goes back to the initial ""connect your Watch to the app"" message. Force closing the Watch app and reopening it seems to fix this, but it's a pain that just shouldn't happen.

The problem always is the taking of the photos — I go outside for the lighting, I use a pure black background, I use a support for my arm so the iPad doesn’t move .... and still I get ‘CP001 the picture isn’t clear enough’ .... or ‘Scanning failed’ ... or ‘Oops, something went wrong’.  After about 20 minutes, I usually give up, although every now and then one maddeningly succeeds, so I am sucked into trying to use it again.

It’s not even in “pending folder”. It’s very hard to know how much actually I got money on my bank account. I have to write it down myself on piece of paper which is kind disappointing since app suppose to do that for me 

Also, Blue Reward turned into a scam. You take £4 out of my bank account every month. Then you say you pay out £3.50 per each direct debit. I get £7 back (for two direct debits).
1. Technically you pay me only £3 so don’t say you give me £3.50 per each direct debit. £4 out of £7 is mine
2. During lockdown I stopped one of my direct debits. You were still taking £4 out of my account and were paying back only £3.50 instead of £7 (for one direct debit that I was still using)
So you were “robbing” me of £0.50 each time. How is that reward?  I see it as a scam and would not expect to be scammed by my own bank that I’ve been with for years.

1. The app feels sluggish. It feels like the devs tried to disguise it with useless animations and transitions. Maybe it's those animations that slow things down?

2. When you try to multi task this app logs you out and does not remember where you left off. For example you look down your expenses on an account, switch to another app for a few seconds then come back the barclays app and the app returns to its start page. It's great that your have to sign in again but super irritating that all state is lost.

3. When you make a transfer, if you start by typing the amount you want to send then choose the account the money should come from, it resets the value (amount to send) you just typed. Why?

I really use to praise this app a few years ago.

Particularly the blank back of the cheque causes the most random images, even the narrowest of isosceles triangles, bearing no relation to what is in front of the camera.

The developers have fixed this issue once (that I know of) in one release, but as soon as it was next updated the issue returned as is still present today.

2. There are many suffering minorities, and to my knowledge, Barclays have only highlighted one minority above others. This is particularly galling given how powerful the LGBT+ lobby is, dominating media and many boardrooms (in contrast to, for example, black rights).

3. Banks obviously do not exist to preference a particular political agenda, and especially when they represent a broad and diverse customer base.

4. The Pride movement has much disagreement and vitriol even within itself, given the competing and often contradictory agendas of different groups represented by different letters. For example, many gay people are opposed to the aggressive beliefs of some transgender campaigners.

After it had been working perfectly fine on recent occasions, the “pay in a cheque” feature now seems to have serious issues. It simply will not take a photo of the flippin’ cheque!!! Somewhat fundamental to this feature working if you ask me.
